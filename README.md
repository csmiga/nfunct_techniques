nfunct behaviors are performance test cases written in Python using Locust IO for
automated performance testing. Automated testing adds value in a software development life cycle (SDLC) using continuous integration and continuous delivery
(CI/CD) or other practices. Speed of delivery while maintaining quaility is the
requirement.

### What is non-functional testing

Non-functional testing is the testing of a software application or system for its non-functional requirements: the way a system operates, rather than specific behaviours of that system. This is in contrast to functional testing, which tests against functional requirements that describe the functions of a system and its components. The names of many non-functional tests are often used interchangeably because of the overlap in scope between various non-functional requirements. For example, software performance is a broad term that includes many specific requirements like reliability and scalability.

### Non-functional testing includes

  * Baseline testing
  * Compliance testing
  * Documentation testing
  * Endurance testing or reliability testing
  * Load testing
  * Localization testing and Internationalization testing
  * Performance testing
  * Recovery testing
  * Resilience testing
  * Security testing
  * Scalability testing
  * Stress testing
  * Usability testing
  * Volume testing
