### What is Non-functional Testing

Non-functional testing is the testing of a software application or system for its non-functional requirements: the way a system operates, rather than specific behaviours of that system. This is in contrast to functional testing, which tests against functional requirements that describe the functions of a system and its components. The names of many non-functional tests are often used interchangeably because of the overlap in scope between various non-functional requirements. For example, software performance is a broad term that includes many specific requirements like reliability and scalability. In short, non-functional testing is a software testing technique that verifies the attributes of the system such as memory leaks, performance or robustness of the system. Non-Functional testing is performed at all test levels.
