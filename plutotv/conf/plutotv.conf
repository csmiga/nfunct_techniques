# WEB UI OPTIONS:
# --------------
# Host to bind the web interface to. Defaults to '*' (all interfaces).

# MASTER OPTIONS:
# --------------
# Options for running a Locust Master node when running Locust distributed. A
# Master node need Worker nodes that connect to it before it can run load tests.

# Set locust to run in distributed mode with this process as master.
# master

# Interfaces (hostname, ip) that locust master should bind to. Only used when
# running with "master" option. Defaults to * (all available interfaces).

# option.
# Defaults to 5557.
# master-bind-port MASTER_BIND_PORT

# How many workers master should expect to connect before starting the test
# only when "headless" option is used.
# expect-workers EXPECT_WORKERS


# WORKER OPTIONS:
# --------------
# Options for running a Locust Worker node when running Locust distributed.
# Only the LOCUSTFILE (-f option) need to be specified when starting a Worker,
# since other options such as -u, -r, -t are specified on the Master node.

# Set locust to run in distributed mode with this process as worker.
# worker

# Host or IP address of locust master for distributed load testing. Only used
# when running with "worker" option. Defaults to 127.0.0.1.
# master-host MASTER_NODE_HOST

# The port to connect to that is used by the locust master for distributed load
# testing. Only used when running with "worker" option. Defaults to 5557.
# master-port MASTER_NODE_PORT


# TAG OPTIONS:
# -----------
# Locust tasks can be tagged using the @tag decorator. These options let specify
# which tasks to include or exclude during a test.

# List of tags to include in the test, so only tasks with any matching tags will
# be executed.
# tags [TAG [TAG ...]]

# List of tags to exclude from the test, so only tasks with no matching tags.
# exclude-tags [TAG [TAG ...]]


# REQUEST STATISTICS OPTIONS:
# --------------------------
# Store current request stats to files in CSV format. Setting this option will
# generate three files: [CSV_PREFIX]_stats.csv, [CSV_PREFIX]_stats_history.csv
# and [CSV_PREFIX]_failures.csv.
# csv CSV_PREFIX

# Store each stats entry in CSV format to _stats_history.csv file.
# csv-full-history

# Print stats in the console.
# print-stats

# Only print the summary stats.
# only-summary

# Reset statistics once hatching has been completed. Should be set on both
# master and workers when running in distributed mode.
# reset-stats


# LOGGING OPTIONS:
# ---------------
# Disable Locust's logging setup. Instead, the configuration is provided by the
# Locust test or Python defaults.
# skip-log-setup

# Choose between DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR/CRITICAL. Default is INFO.
# loglevel LOGLEVEL
loglevel INFO

# Path to log file. If not set, log will go to stdout/stderr.
# logfile LOGFILE
logfile ./log/nfunct.log


# STEP LOAD OPTIONS:
# -----------------
# Enable Step Load mode to monitor how performance metrics varies when user load
# increases. Requires "step-users" and "step-time" options to be specified.
# step-load

# User count to increase by step in Step Load mode. Only used together with
# "step-load" option.
# step-users STEP_USERS

# Step duration in Step Load mode, e.g. (300s, 20m, 3h, 1h30m, etc.). Only used
# together with "step-load" option.
# step-time STEP_TIME


# OTHER OPTIONS:
# -------------
# Print table of the User classes' task execution ratio.
# show-task-ratio

# Print json data of the User classes' task execution ratio.
# show-task-ratio-json

# Show program's version number and exit.
# version

# Sets the process exit code to use when a test result contain any failure or
# error.
# exit-code-on-error EXIT_CODE_ON_ERROR

# Number of seconds to wait for a simulated user to complete any executing task
# before exiting. Default is to terminate immediately. This parameter only needs
# to be specified for the master process when running Locust distributed.
